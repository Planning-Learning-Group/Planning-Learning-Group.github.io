### General research topics

Within our lab, we are a specialized group on automated planning, scheduling and machine learning technologies. 
We have experience in different techniques to automate business services and complex tasks, and we contribute 
a complete and integrating viewpoint in all our proposals. Our primary research areas are Automated Planning, 
Reinforcement Learning and Heuristics. Our main topics of interest include:

* Automating dynamic processes of planning and decision making
* Optimizing processes from intelligent data analysis (including data mining) to predict patterns or risks
* Designing of intelligent information retrieval systems - data mining based on last generation techniques
* Improving of on-line systems through the use of intelligent agents in Internet
* Applying artificial intelligence techniques to companies problem solving (business intelligence)

In summary, we work to create Ai systems that can solve complex problems in many areas
using decision making tecniques.
