## Welcome!

The research group PLG started on 2003 from the Scalab research group at the Department of Computer Science, 
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. We are a specialized group on automated planning, decision-making and 
machine learning technologies. You can find us in the Sabatini building at the lab [2.1.B16](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MHvyPMX29Q7wEabN7).

In PLG we develop algorithms for acting in complex environments using automated
planning and machine learning. We offer a highly qualified human team and our [research topics]({filename}projects.md)
include:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Automated Planning
* Heuristic Optimizations
* Machine Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
