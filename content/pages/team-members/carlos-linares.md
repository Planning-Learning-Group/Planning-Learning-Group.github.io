**About Me**

I am an Associate Professor of the Computer Science and Engineering Department
at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. My main research interests are
Heuristic Search and Automated Planning.

**Short bio**

As Associate Professor I've been taken different lecturing and administrative
positions. Among others, deputy director of International Relations since 2013
until 2015, Faculty deputy manager since 2017 until 2021, and Deputy Director
for Bachelor in Computer Engineering since December, 2020 until now.

Before joining Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, I worked in different companies
in the private and public sectors, always in positions related to Artificial
Intelligence. Among others, I worked for the ENVISAT mission of the European
Space Agency (ESRIN, Frascati - Italy).

I obtained my Bs. degree in Computer Science in 1995, and a PhD degree in
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in 2001, both from Universidad
Polit√©cnica de Madrid. I also hold a MsC in Knowledge Engineering from the same
University from 1997. My research activity has resulted in more than 60
publications, and different national and international awards, such as: the best
pre-doctoral work awarded by the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence
in 1997; Outstanding Programme Committe Member of the American Association for
the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2008; two silver medals in the SAT
competition in 2013; and a first position in the international competition of
Learning for Planning. I joined more than 20 national and international projects
and have contributed to more than 30 Programme Committees both as a reviewer or
Senior Programme Committee member.
