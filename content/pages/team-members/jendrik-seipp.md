**About me**

I'm an associate professor in Artificial Intelligence at [Linköping
University](https://liu.se/), Sweden, and I lead the [Machine Reasoning Lab]({filename}../home.md) in the [AIICS](https://www.ida.liu.se/divisions/aiics/) division. My main research interests
are AI planning and its connections to machine learning.

**Short bio**

I received my MSc in computer science from the [University of
Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/), Germany, in December 2012. In March
2018, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Malte
Helmert](https://ai.dmi.unibas.ch/people/helmert/) with the [Artificial
Intelligence group](https://ai.dmi.unibas.ch) at the [University of
Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/), Switzerland. Afterwards, I stayed on as a
postdoc until I became assistant professor at [Linköping
University](https://liu.se/), Sweden, in January 2021. In September 2023,
I was promoted to associate professor.

For more information, please see my [academic CV]({static}/resources/jendrik-seipp-cv.pdf).

My office [2G:466](https://link.mazemap.com/uS9u3EnN) is located in the E-building at Campus Valla in Linköping.
