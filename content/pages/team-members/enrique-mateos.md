**About Me**

I am a Ph.D. student at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. I work at the  Computer Science and Engineering Department, in the Planning & Learning Group (PLG). My main research areas are Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. My work focuses on optimizing decision-making systems, particularly in environments that balance efficiency and sustainability.

**Short bio**

I got my bachelor's on Computer Science and Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and my master's on Applied Artificial Intelligence at the same university. I got the Best Academic Record Award for the Computer Science and Engineering Promotion of 2022/23. I have collaborated with Repsol S.A. in several projects involving Reinforcement Learning in indutrial environments and on a multi-agent RL environment that simulates a city with fuel and electric vehicles, exploring strategies for transitioning refueling stations from fuel pumps to electric chargers.
