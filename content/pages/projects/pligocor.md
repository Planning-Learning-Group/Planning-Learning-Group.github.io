### PLIGOCOR (2016)

Optimal planning software tool designed to solve problems related to route generation. One of the application's outputs will be the optimal and automatic generation of route offerings based on an input demand. This demand may involve the collection of passengers/materials from multiple origins to a single destination, or the distribution of passengers/materials from a single origin to various destinations. The application will be useful for any collective transport sector, with its performance validated in school transportation.
