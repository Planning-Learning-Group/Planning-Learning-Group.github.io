### ARPIA (2018)

Providing agents (both human and software) with recommendations on future behavior 
(actions, plans or goals) based on learning models of their past behavior and recognition 
of their present actions, plans or goals. In order to achieve the objective, we will 
integrate techniques from machine learning, activity/plan recognition and automated 
planning. The key idea is to analyze information from sensors in order to generate 
diverse models of an agent's behavior, such as planning domain models, probabilistic 
models, or generic classifiers. Read more about the project [here](https://arpia.blogs.upv.es/).
