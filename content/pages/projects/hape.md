### Human-Aware Planning & Execution (2022)

 As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies enter our everyday lives at an 
 increasing pace there is a greater need for AI systems that work synergistically
  with humans. The main objective of this project is to analyze, develop and 
  evaluate new methods, algorithms and tools that support the use and application 
  of Automated Planning and Machine Learning to create intelligent systems in real 
  scenarios where humans play a main role due to its implication on the design of 
  the system, the deliberation or reasoning processes or the actual resolution of 
  the specific task. We turn our attention towards human-centric applications for: 
  (1) supporting the human in the definition of use cases, (2) learning from human 
  and agent deliberation to improve automated problem solving and (3) learning from 
  plan observations to support the human in reaching her goals.
