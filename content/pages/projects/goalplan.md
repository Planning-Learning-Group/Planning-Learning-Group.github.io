### GoalPLAN (2019)

Software that ensures strategic planning for multimodal and urban public transport, 
fully adapted to the mobility needs of Smart Cities, capable of competing with the 
use of private transport. To achieve this, origin-destination matrices will be generated
 based on mobility data from telecommunications operators using AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
 techniques. Additionally, a reasoning engine will be developed, incorporating new optimization 
 algorithms that consider constraints to address the Transit Network Problem (TNP).
