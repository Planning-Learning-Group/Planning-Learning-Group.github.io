## Seminar: Graph Learning (PhD course)

In this seminar, we cover different neural-network architectures for representing graphs. The participants read and present selected papers, which will be discussed during the meetings.

The following topics will be covered:

* Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
* Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
* Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNN)
* Graph Transformer Architectures
* Expressive Power of different Architectures
* Applications in Symbolic Reasoning
